# Erlang & Elixir â€“ A Different Way to Build a System

This was a presentation I gave to the [Western Mass Web Developers/ Designers Meetup group](https://www.meetup.com/wmasswebdev/events/238081057/) where I wanted to get across some fundamental architectural concepts in Erlang & Elixir. I tried a different approach than I'd seen in other presentations. I tried to stay away from syntax as much as I could to keep my audience's attention. I wanted to focus not on how Elixir was different, but how it was _special_ in the programming model it enabled.
